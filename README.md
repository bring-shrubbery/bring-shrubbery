# Hey, nice to meet you!

My name is **Antoni**, I like coding and optimising things.

I'm doing *full-stack* development professionally, focusing on *TypeScript*, *React*, *Node.js* and *GraphQL*.

I also enjoy learning new things, teaching what I know best and creating open-source software.

If you like any of my open-source projects you see below, please give them a star! ğŸ˜‡ -->

My name is **Antoni**, I make **simple**, **scalable** and **maintainable** software while trying to make it as open-source as possible.

You can learn more about me by running `ssh cv.antoni.ai` in your terminal.

This is my favourite professional stack core right now:

- TypeScript, Rust, Go
- Next.js, SvelteKit, Solid Start, Astro
- React Query + Zustand or Jotai
- tRPC or GraphQL
- Prisma + Planetscale/Neon/Aurora + Redis

> **P.S.** You can also check out my [CV here](https://read.cv/antoni). Or learn how you can [support my projects](https://github.com/bring-shrubbery/bring-shrubbery/blob/main/SUPPORT.md).
