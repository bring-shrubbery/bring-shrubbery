# Hey, nice to meet you!

My name is **Antoni**, I like coding and optimising things.

I'm doing *full-stack* development professionally, focusing on *TypeScript*, *React*, *Node.js* and *GraphQL*.

I also enjoy learning new things, teaching what I know best and creating open-source software.

If you like any of my open-source projects you see below, please give them a star! ðŸ˜‡ -->

My name is **Antoni**,

I build **simple**, **scalable** and **maintainable** software. Best UI/UX is reached through incremental iteration.

This is my favourite professional stack core right now:

- TypeScript, Go, Rust
- Next.js, SvelteKit, Astro
- Xstate + Zustand/Jotai
- tRPC / OpenAPI + React Query / Server Components
- Prisma with Kysely + Planetscale + Redis
