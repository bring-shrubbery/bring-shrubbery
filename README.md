# Hey, nice to meet you!

My name is **Antoni**, I like coding and optimising things.

I'm doing *full-stack* development professionally, focusing on *TypeScript*, *React*, *Node.js* and *GraphQL*.

I also enjoy learning new things, teaching what I know best and creating open-source software.

If you like any of my open-source projects you see below, please give them a star! ğŸ˜‡ -->

My name is **Antoni**, I aim to make **simple**, **well architected**, **high quality** software and I try to make it as open-source as possible.

This is my current "perfect" professional base stack:

- TypeScript, Rust, Go
- Next.js + Turborepo
- Zustand or Jotai (No more Redux ğŸ’©)
- GraphQL _(I also don't mind OpenAPI REST + React Query, tRPC)_
- Prisma + Planetscale (or AWS Aurora, Redis, MongoDB)

If you need help with a similar stack, feel free to contact me :)

> **P.S.** You can also check out my [CV here](https://read.cv/antoni)!
