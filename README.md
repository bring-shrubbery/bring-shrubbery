# Hey, nice to meet you!

My name is **Antoni**, I like coding and optimising things.

I'm doing *full-stack* development professionally, focusing on *TypeScript*, *React*, *Node.js* and *GraphQL*.

I also enjoy learning new things, teaching what I know best and creating open-source software.

If you like any of my open-source projects you see below, please give them a star! ðŸ˜‡ -->

My name is **Antoni**,

I like building things and seeing people enjoy things I build.

I don't limit my interests to any stack, but I specialise in TypeScript, React and PostgreSQL. I really like what tRPC, Svelte, Swift, Rust, Go (and more) are doing for the app development community.

If you'd like to know what I think, feel free to check out my blog or youtube channel ðŸ–¤
