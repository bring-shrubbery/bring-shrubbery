# Hey, nice to meet you!

My name is **Antoni**, I like coding and optimising things.

I'm doing *full-stack* development professionally, focusing on *TypeScript*, *React*, *Node.js* and *GraphQL*.

I also enjoy learning new things, teaching what I know best and creating open-source software.

If you like any of my open-source projects you see below, please give them a star! ðŸ˜‡ -->


# Hey ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Antoni**, I aim to make **simple**, **well architected**, **high quality** software and I try to make it as open-source as possible.

This is my current "perfect" professional stack:

- TypeScript + Rust
- Next.js _(no Redux)_
- GraphQL _(I also don't mind OpenAPI REST, tRPC, WebRTC)_
- Prisma
- Planetscale + Redis

If you need help with a similar stack, feel free to contact me :)
