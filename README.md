# Hey, nice to meet you!

My name is **Antoni**, I like coding and optimising things.

I'm doing *full-stack* development professionally, focusing on *TypeScript*, *React*, *Node.js* and *GraphQL*.

I also enjoy learning new things, teaching what I know best and creating open-source software.

If you like any of my open-source projects you see below, please give them a star! ğŸ˜‡ -->

My name is **Antoni**, I make **simple**, **well architected**, **maintainable** software and I try to make it as open-source as possible.

This is my favourite professional stack right now:

- TypeScript, Rust, Go
- Next.js
- Turborepo
- Zustand OR Jotai (No Redux ğŸ’©)
- tRPC or GraphQL
- Prisma + Planetscale (or other serverless SQL)
