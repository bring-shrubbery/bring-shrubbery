# How to support me

Thanks for wanting to support me!

There are two main ways you can support me:

1. Directly, via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/bring-shrubbery) or [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bring.shrubbery).
2. By using my **referrals**:
   - [Railway](https://railway.app?referralCode=antoni) - super easy backend deployments. Use referral code `antoni` when registering or [click here](https://railway.app?referralCode=antoni) and register.
   - ...more tbd.
   - You could also buy something from Amazon by using my [referral link here](https://www.amazon.de/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=antonisilvest-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2d42316193a66f2cc3af0cb489302128&camp=1638&creative=6742&node=340843031) and I'll get a small portion of the tax that Amazon takes usually.
